# Elements-Of-Machine-Learning-Course
Repository contains assignments completed as part of "Elements of Machine Learning" Course.

Assignment1: Data preprocessing, Feature selection, Linear Regression fit, Performed a hypothesis test on whether there is a statistically significant relationship between the predictors(used seaborn.scatterplot), and used KNeighborRegressor

Assignment2: Used StratifiedShuffleSplit for splitting, Fit model using LDA and another using QDA and generated and compared the confusion matrix for them.

Assignment3: Implemented least squares regression, fit ridge regression functions, generated predictions funstions, mean square error function using numpy functions for vectorization. Implemented and experimented with k-fold cross validation and LOOCV.

Assignment4: Implemented a piecewise polynomial regression and using smoothing splines. Evaluated and compared the results.

Assignment5: Performed clustering, using K-means algorithm from scratch. Experimented  with Dimensionality reduction using PCA and TSNE classes from sklearn.
